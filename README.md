#Cropper
The commend line interface can be used by calling ``python ./cropper/cli.py ...`` with the correct arguments. See ``python ./cropper/cli.py -h`` for the arguments. 

Interfacing with ``cropper`` from other scriptss can be via the ``cropper.dataset`` module. Note that there are still some problem caveats when using this approach, see these issues:
