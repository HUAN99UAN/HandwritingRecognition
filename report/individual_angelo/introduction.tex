In section \ref{ss:methods:preprocessing} we present the process of cleaning our textual data. In section \ref{ss:methods:characterSegmentation} we show how we split the words into characters whilst in section \ref{ss:methods:featureExtraction} we show the features we extracted from the characters to be used in the classification process. In section \ref{ss:methods:machineLearing} we present our machine learning approach and in section \ref{s:results} we present our results for both the characters and the words. Finally in section \ref{s:discussion} and \ref{s:conclusion} we present the discussion as well as our conclusions respectively.
