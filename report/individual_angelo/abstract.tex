	Off-line hand writing recognition has been an issue between researches for a long time. Various techniques have been introduce and implemented most of which are performing well for the most part. In cases however that the characters have no clear borders within the word itself, things can get more complicated. In this paper we present such a case as well as our approach to solve the problem and achieve translation of the characters provided to ASCII.
