\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{L.E.N. Baakman}
L.E.N. Baakman implemented the used framework, designed and implemented the segmentation algorithm and the recognizer. Furthermore she optimized the code written for the pre-processing, feature extraction and post-processing. Other than \cref{ss:methods:preprocessing} and \ref{ss:methods:featureExtraction}, this paper was written by her.
