Character images are represented with crossings feature vectors. Each feature vector consisted of 128 elements, 64 the in horizontal direction and 64 in the vertical direction. Before counting the vertical crossings in the image the image was scaled to have a width of 64 pixels. For the computation of the horizontal crossing the image was scaled to have a height of 64 pixels. Both scale operations kept preserved the aspect ratio of the image.
