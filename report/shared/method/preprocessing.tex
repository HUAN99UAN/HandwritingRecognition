The main goal of our preprocessing step is to remove noise, a the characters do not need to be normalized.
% Luminosity normalization
Luminosity normalization removes differences between images due to worn off ink. This step linearly scales the image to the intensity range of the $500 \times 500$ center rectangle of the image. \Cref{fig:methods:preprocessing:lumNormalization} shows the results of global thresholding with and without luminosity filter, illustrating that  without this normalization most of the text would have disappeared after the global thresholding. 
% Global thresholding
Otsu's \cite{otsu1975threshold} method is used to separate the foreground from the background. 
% Opening by Reconstruction
The last preprocessing step is the removal of small components in the image via opening with a $3 \times 3$ rectangular structuring element.
