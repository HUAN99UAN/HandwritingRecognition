The post precessing is our final step. At this point, we have the extracted data from the recognizer however it can be the case that some letter have been recognized wrongly. To deal with this we decided to look into the frequency that letters appear in the documents we received. Once we have our data, we make one to one comparison between our data and the lexicon provided to us and if the terms do not match exactly we measure the distance between the two strings. For the measuring we tested both Hamming distance \cite{norouzi2012hamming} and Levenshtein distance \cite{heeringa2004measuring}. In general they performed quite similarly but Levenshtein distance took significantly more time to complete.
