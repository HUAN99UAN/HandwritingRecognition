implemented the used framework and the recognizer. She also designed and implemented the segmentation algorithm. Furthermore she optimized the code written for the pre-processing, feature extraction and post-processing. This paper was completely authored by her, it should be noted that \cref{sss:introduction:offline:preprocessing}, \ref{sss:introduction:offline:representation}, \ref{ss:methods:preprocessing} and \ref{ss:methods:featureExtraction} are (partly) based on text provided by E. Karountzos.

set up the initial versions of the pre-processing, feature extraction and post-processing. He also wrote the text that \cref{sss:introduction:offline:preprocessing}, \ref{sss:introduction:offline:representation}, \ref{ss:methods:preprocessing} and \ref{ss:methods:featureExtraction} are (partly) based on.
