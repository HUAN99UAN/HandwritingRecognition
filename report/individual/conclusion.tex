Based on the difference between the validation segmentation and the binary over segmentation the segmentation algorithm seems to work reasonably well. The recognizer as a whole performs badly due to non distinguishable feature vectors. It is possible that this is partly caused by insufficient preprocessing for a lest half of the data. But as the differences between the two subsets are not that big, it its quite likely that the crossings feature vectors are insufficient.
