In section \ref{sec:prepro} we present the process of cleaning our textual data. In section \ref{sec:charsegm} we show how we split the words into characters whilst in section \ref{sec:feat} we show the features we extracted from the characters to be used in the classification process. In section \ref{sec:machlearn} we present our machine learning approach and in section \ref{sec:results} we present our results for both the characters and the words. Finally in section \ref{sec:discussion} and \ref{sec:conc} we present the discussion as well as our conclusions respectively.
